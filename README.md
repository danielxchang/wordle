# Wordle Clone

This full-stack project was built with the MERN stack.

The front-end UI was built with React. The back-end API was built with Express and Node.js. Lastly, the application uses a MongoDB database to store and access data.


See https://github.com/dcphantom/wordle-api for the back-end API GitHub repo, from which the API is actually deployed with Heroku.
